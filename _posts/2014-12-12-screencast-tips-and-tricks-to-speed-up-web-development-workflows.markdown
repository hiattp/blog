meta: "Here are some tips and tricks that you should be using to speed up your development workflows if you aren't already."

One of my [recent posts][recent-post] got into some esoteric hypotheses about why
many developers adopt inefficient development styles and practices, so I wanted to
jump to the opposite side of the theory-practice spectrum and show a few ways I speed
up my daily workflows.

I'm using Vim and working on a Rails project here but the intent is to show
strategies that should be cross-platform and cross-editor---you'll just have to figure out
analogues to achieve the same thing if you aren't using Vim on OSX.

I also want to note that none of this is novel so you've probably seen or heard
of these tools, in which case this is just a nudge to use them if you aren't
already. Enjoy!
