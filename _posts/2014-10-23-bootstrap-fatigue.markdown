I work with a lot of startups needing MVPs, and few "earliest" stage companies
want to spend funds on design resources. Invariably this
means turning to Bootstrap for some out-of-the-box aesthetics, so we end up with
sexy well-tested server code and front ends that looks like
[this][bootstrap-example].

My go-to for spicing things up is [wrap bootstrap][wrapboot], but while that
saves you on one or two pages (for a small fee) you'll probably end up with a
dramatic disparity between the landing page design and everything else.

### Enter Bootswatch

I was recently introduced to [Bootswatch][bootswatch] and used the Journal theme on
my latest client project. Hats off to [Thomas Park][thomas] for his work on
this, I think I'd go crazy if I had to stare at the default Bootstrap navbar for
another week. And any more the bootstrappy look seems to suggest a premature
launch rather than cutting edge templating.
