Life update: I've been transitioning to [Lockstep Labs][lockstep],
a new development firm that specializes in web and mobile applications for
startups and high-growth tech companies. As a group of technologists, sought-after
freelancers and entrepreneurs we've
enjoyed the flexibility and excitement of building applications single handedly.
We've lived and worked remotely all over the world, indulging in the
work-on-the-beach-while-sipping-martinis lifestyle. It was awesome.

But the lone wolf engineer-for-hire lifestyle has some significant drawbacks.
You generally work on smaller projects. You typically design and code in a
vacuum, which limits the important idea cross-pollination of pair
programming and team settings. And while you contribute to remote teams
and meet other interesting freelancers, you never have the same sense of
community that forms around the common purpose and vision of well run
organizations.

So that chapter is closing. I'm continuing to work on my own ventures and open
source projects, but within the larger Lockstep context. We are
starting an exciting project with a Y Combinator portfolio company that would
have been too large for any of us individually, and we have a nice "Friday
afternoon beers" tradition already taking shape. I'm thrilled to see where it
takes me and the rest of the team!
