We've been busy at [Lockstep][lockstep] and it seems that
the human body doesn't take kindly to extended periods of furious typing
(especially in the genre of keys that Vim and Emacs encourage). A good
balance of exercise and regular breaks will help, but sticking with the
traditional keyboard approach (QWERTY on the desk) ignores other important
options. I'm a fan of alternative keyboard configurations and
[Kinesis][kinesis] products but I thought I'd try a chair mounted version as
well. Here is the latest iteration!

I'm happy so far; as long as you can touch-type your brain knows which keyboard
to use automatically so the learning curve is negligible and I've noticed a huge
decrease in wrist strain.

The left keyboard is on a pivot so it swings out of way when you want to get in
and out.

This is actually version two, the proof of concept used tripods to stand up the
keyboards so I could try it out with different chairs. Constantly bumping into
the tripods and getting them placed just right was a huge pain.

The next iteration will include a mounted touch pad near the right keyboard, and
I think the arm rests will need to be slightly wider. This version is a lot more
practical than tripods but I've noticed that your elbows naturally want a wider
berth than normal arm rests allow.
