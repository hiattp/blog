Entirely in-house, co-located development teams are growing increasingly uncommon.
Companies are realizing that a good phone/internet
connection is a highly efficient substitute for a cubical,
and good developers in the area are never available when you need them. This has
led to a huge surge in remote work and distributed contractors, but some
companies manage this process better than others. Here are a few issues that I see
almost everyone get wrong.


### Mistake #1: Shopping for Cost, not Quality

I frequently see the concept of a
remote team conflated with the idea of cheap outsourcing (of textile/automobile
fame). And yet the markets are fundamentally different: Manufacturers are taking
advantage of an arbitrage opportunity where physical labor is geographically
restricted and thereby trapped in its own low-cost market, to be repackaged and
resold as high-value goods in high-cost markets. Knowledge work *does not share
that geographic restriction*, and thus does not present the same opportunity for
cost arbitrage.

The 1970s "cheap outsourcing" attitude towards remote worker looks like this:
If you can overcome the distance barrier by working with a developer in
India or Eastern Europe, you'll receive some kind of discount per unit of
quality work and be able to leverage that in your more expensive market (the US
or Europe).

I'm sorry to say that this is not the case. Today's technology makes distance a
non-issue in the majority of development projects, so shopping abroad for
low-cost labor basically just translates to shopping for low-cost labor, which
you can find at home (hint: look for someone who is inexperienced or unskilled).

There is great development talent abroad. But if you have this outsourcing
mentality, you are probably shopping for *cost* when you should be looking for
*quality*. The major caveat is that **the talent
won't be dramatically less expensive than it is at home** -- the market for
technology is global, and doesn't really care where you are.

Now I'm not saying there aren't opportunities to save money, and I'm downplaying
the challenges of work at a distance to make a point. But the next time you find
yourself wondering if that $15/hour developer in Pakistan is going to put out
work like the $150/hour senior developer in California, here's your answer: He
won't. (And the $100/hour Pakistani engineer down the street may well beat
out both.)

### Mistake #2: Underestimating Communication Barriers

In preparation for this post I calculated the word count of all emails that I
exchanged with a recent client regarding a fairly standard Minimum Viable
Product build. I removed all meaningless content (e.g. datestamps, reply
summaries, etc) and signatures so only unique product-related communication
remained. Together we accumulated **over 50,000 words** of email over the
roughly three months of the project, in addition to
hours of regularly scheduled calls. That is either a long novella or a short
book, depending on how you look at it.

Just for some context we are both highly educated, native English speakers. And
you can safely assume we were being as concise as possible (no room for fluff in
discussing complex systems).

People often assume a significant hourly cost discount is worth a little
communication barrier, but I'd argue this is the **number one cause of all
product development failures** in remote work. It will end up costing
you more money over the long run than any amount you will save up front.
And this isn't just language proficiency; communication even in your native
tongue is a skill that is honed over time.  I rank the ability to
communicate higher than technical proficiency every single time.

### Mistake #3: Scope Creep, Scope Creep, Scope Creep

The challenge in many contracted development projects (i.e. the people building it
do not have a vested stake in the product) is that **you are going to get what
you ask for, which is never exactly what you want**. Custom applications *always*
change based on early usage and user feedback, which means that you need to work
with someone who understands how to adapt and anticipate requirements throughout
the life of the project, not just while creating the initial spec sheet.

But there is a limit to this flexibility. In web applications, **features beget
features** and one minor tweak can quickly morph into hours or additional work
for a developer, either from unanticipated complexity or unforeseen additional
features that become necessary during implementation (these are commonly
misrepresented as "bugs" that need to be fixed).

This cycle of scope creep can be extremely demoralizing to a development team,
who is unlikely to bill the extra hours either because it is a fixed-price job
and they can't, or because they don't want to blindside clients with unforeseen
costs. And outside of internalized financial burdens, a moving goalpost in any
complex project kills motivation and throws off development time lines (both for
your project and other projects the team is working on).

It is impossible to avoid this in all cases (which is why you hear about it so
frequently), but the key as a product manager is to identify when it happens and
adjust the [project triangle][triangle] accordingly.
