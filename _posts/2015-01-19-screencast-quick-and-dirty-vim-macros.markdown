Ever wonder what all the hype is about Vim macros? I didn't start using them
until I was already very familiar with Vim, mostly because I didn't know what
the heck they were and what they did.

If you haven't started incorporating macros into your work flow, here is a quick
example of when, why and how you'd whip out a quick macro to speed up your next
hack.

<div class="bt-video-container" style="position:relative;padding-bottom:75.00%;padding-top:30px;height:0;overflow:hidden"><iframe width="480" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Y4niqBfZjEo?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>

See some shortcuts I didn't mention? I cover some basic productivity
enhancements/shortcuts in this [previous screencast][recent-post].
