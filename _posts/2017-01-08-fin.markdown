It has been over two years since my first blog post. In my days
as a freelancer this blog was a fantastic way to build
credibility, generate leads and increase reference links to my
primary marketing pages. As [Lockstep][lockstep] matured and
my responsibilities shifted from active development to
product management and sales my content
creation dwindled to a nearly imperceptible trickle as
both time and inspiration fled to other necessary action items.
Since it doesn't look like that will be changing in the near future
I've decided to retire the blog, but leave it online for reference.

Please don't hesitate to reach out about technical product builds or
consulting engagements! While this blog is headed for the shelf my
consulting practice is alive and well, and we are always looking for
exciting new projects!
